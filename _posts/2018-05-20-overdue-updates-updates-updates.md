Whew! A lot has changed! 

Both personally and with this site!

In personal news, earlier this year I made the jump from product management in healthcare technology into product management at the intersection of data science, media, and television. I need to update a bunch of content on the site, but more on that later.

In website news, [GitHub finally rolled out HTTPS support earlier this month](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/). It's been a [long requested feature](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156), and given that Google's made [HTTPS a factor in PageRank](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html), couldn't come soon enough. Anyway, I've since jumped on board and have enabled *Enforced HTTPS*. There was a bit of site tweaking that needed to be done to resolve formatting and mixed content issues, but I think most of that has been taken care of. 

And in more news, I've managed to get ahold of the [anthonynguyen.com](anthonynguyen.com) domain—no more .digital suffix!

In terms of next projects, things include migrating the site over to that domain, possibly updating the Minimal Mistakes theme, finding a new solution for the [now deprecated Google reCaptcha v1 service](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq) (ugh—there's no obvious [MailHide](https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/221) replacement! sorry that it's broken, I'll need a new way to list my email here), and maybe, just maybe get this Javascript rotating banners thing worked out. :sweat_smile:

ps - technically, you *can* still get past the MailHide reCaptcha check to contact me, either try clicking on the `Reveal email address` button a few times with no entry, or try putting in the entire phrase, `reCAPTCHA V1 IS SHUTDOWN` into the text prompt! :grimacing:
