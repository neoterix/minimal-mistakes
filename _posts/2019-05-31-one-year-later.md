I had planned to update this more, but my time at Schireson was busy! We had some big, ambitious goals (that we hit!), and released some great software.

Anyway, I have some time to be finally revisiting things and updating the site
a bit. A few small things that have already been updated:

* So after buying my own .com domain, I finally migrated it to be the primary domain for this site instead of a temporary forward. Now [anthonynguyen.com](https://anthonynguyen.com/) is properly hosting things, and [anthonynguyen.digital](https://anthonynguyen.com/) is a forward.
* Finally replaced the email link with a new Captcha solution. [This thread here](https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/221) has some great discussion of how folks were dealing with the deprecation of Google's reCaptcha v1 service, and there were some great alternative service suggestions. After trying a few, I settled on [https://mailhide.io](https://mailhide.io).

In terms of plans, I've already made some small tweaks and updates to reflect where I'm at. I have some ideas around rewriting a bunch of the site and modernizing it, and possibly bringing the site up the latest version of the Minimal Mistakes template.
