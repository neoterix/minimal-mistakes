I have an email link now live on the sidebar thanks to [reCAPTCHA's Mailhide service](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey). I stumbled across this earlier today and found it fit exactly what I was looking for: a lightweight way to obscure my email from spam bots, and I don't even need to subscribe to an SaaS email form!
