Welcome to my little spot on the web! I'm currently a product manager at [Schireson Associates](https://www.schireson.com/), building enterprise *advanced advertising* software for linear television. I've also spent several awesome years working on enterprise/SaaS products at [Vitals](http://www.vitals.com), a company focused on digital [healthcare transparency](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/testimonies/2006/mar/transparency-in-health-care--the-time-has-come).

Here you can learn a little more [about me](/about/), read a little of my long(er)-form [writing](/writing/), peruse some of the [projects](/projects) I'm working on, or check out the log of [updates](/blog/updates_by_year.html) to this site.

Finally, please feel welome to reach out to me via any of the means in the sidebar!
