I'm a lawyer

Didn't come in completely blind, when I was younger, I learned basic HTML and even hosted a webpage or two, and even spent my freshman year pursuing electrical engineering and taking Intro to CS. Unfortunately that was a defeating experience and I left that first year with the conviction that a career in technology wasn't for me, and that I should pursue my interests in policy and law.

Ironically, after nearly five years practicing law ... I found myself...

The passion for technology never really left me.



The other details...

## Interests and Hobbies

***Hobbies in active development***: running, karaoke, board games.  
~~*Deprecated hobbies: cycling, photography, social dance.*~~

Despite always getting picked last in gym class in grade school, I've somehow mustered up running a marathon (*slowly*), running two half-marathons (*slightly faster*), completed three century rides (*one with 8,268 ft of total climbing*), competed in an olympic-distance triathalon (*barely*), and participated in a 200 mile, 24-hour team relay (*drowsily*). Don't let any of this fool you, I'm not an athletic person.

Oh, and I never say "no" to karaoke.

## Certifications

I'll be honest, certifications aren't my favorite thing, I think certifications can be weak signal for subject mastery. That said, they are useful to demonstrate a commitment to learning and career growth
