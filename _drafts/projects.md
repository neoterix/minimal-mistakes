This site that you're reading right now is itself a big personal technology project! 

Developing a stronger web presence: better leveraging all of my small contributions by consolidating them all in a single place.

From the start, I knew I wanted to make this project sustainable in the long run, 

which meant not outsourcing the setup, management, and hosting of my site to services like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) or [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) (as nice as those services are). 

The first phase of this project was surveying and understanding what my options are, and quickly arrived at GitHub pages: free and simple to manage.

After getting my `Hello World` page up and my custom domain connected, it was time to move onto bigger things: spinning up something more fully-featured using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular Ruby static site generator. 

While the final(ish) product itself is somewhat unremarkable in that it's a personal website much like the millions out there on the web, it was the product of several days of slow and steady yak shaving progress...

* Getting a Ruby toolchain up on my Chromebook/Android-Termux-Linux frankenstein local dev environment
* Figuring out why my SSH key wasn't cooperating with GitHub 
* Choosing a Jekyll theme that fit my design needs *and* had thorough, novice-friendly documentation
* Getting my chosen Jekyll theme, [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), succesfully forked, locally cloned, and running as a local web server 
* Getting the Jekyll local web server visible by my browser (unfortunately my Chromebook/Android-Termux-Linux frankenstein setup requires jumping through a dozen SSH hoops 
* Reading through the entire Jekyll theme documentation while testing each feature or config on my local web server 
* Finding and studying other people's forks of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to understand how to implement certain designs and how the theme and Jekyll work
* Attempting various customizations to my theme setup... and often not succeeding
* Troubleshooting various idiopathic glitches along the way, like when git push started hanging and no longer worked (the diagnosis involved painstakingly replicating each file change until I uncovered a small file that oddly interfered with pushing changes)

Though this was a larger challenge than I had originally (and naively) anticipated, it was icnredibly rewarding as a learning experience:

* I'm now fluent with the basic git and Github activities, including cloning, staging, committing, pushing, viewing the log, and well... resetting my commits (doh!)
* I now have a greater appreciation for the value that product management brings to software development-there were definite missteps along the way in terms of not building iteratively, and not prioritizing the highest value efforts (like when I went down a blogpost-indexing rabbit hole...)
* Learning about how to teach yourself: I now understand GitHub (particularly GitHub pages) and the posture towards open, public repositories. Being able to see people's sites and then look through the directories, files, and code is tremendous tool for solving problems and learning.
