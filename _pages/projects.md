A few of my recent projects are highlighted below:

## NYC MTA Subway Arrival Python Script 

As a part of my OneMonth coursework, I decided to see if I could create a script that could access the New York City MTA subway real-time API. This a basic python script that reads the NYC MTA realtime feed API for subway data and outputs when the next arrival is for a given station. It was created as an self-directed educational exercise to build something from scratch and hopefully you might find it useful too!
