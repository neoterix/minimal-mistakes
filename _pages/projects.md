A few of my recent projects are highlighted below:

## NYC MTA Subway Arrival Python Script 

As a part of my [OneMonth](https://onemonth.com/courses/python) coursework, I decided to see if I could create a script that could access the New York City MTA subway real-time API. This a basic python script that reads the NYC MTA realtime feed API for subway data and outputs when the next arrival is for a given station. It was created as an self-directed educational exercise to build something from scratch and hopefully you might find it useful too!

## Learning to Code on a Bone-Stock Chromebook

For the past month or so, I’ve been coding and doing some small development projects: [learning Python](https://onemonth.com/courses/python), setting this [Jekyll-based](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) personal site up, etc. And all of this has been taking place on a completely bone-stock, stable channel Samsung Chromebook Pro.

My adventures learning to code while jumping through all the hoops of doing so on a completely stock Chromebook: [*https://medium.com/@clumsycontraria/learning-to-code-on-a-bone-stock-chromebook-a7d0e75303bb*](https://medium.com/@clumsycontraria/learning-to-code-on-a-bone-stock-chromebook-a7d0e75303bb)
