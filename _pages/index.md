Welcome to my little spot on the web! I'm a product manager on the enterprise/SaaS products team at [Vitals](http://www.vitals.com), a digital company focused on [healthcare transparency](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/testimonies/2006/mar/transparency-in-health-care--the-time-has-come).

Here you can learn a little more [about me](/about/), read a little of my long(er)-form [writing](/writing/), and peruse some of the [projects](/projects) I'm working on.

Finally, please feel welome to reach out to me via any of the means in the sidebar!
