> Pragmatic problem solver. Relentless learner. Principled leader. Attorney-turned-product manager.

Once an attorney that only treated his zeal for technology as a hobby, Anthony now consummates this passion as a product manager at the intersection of data science, television, and advertising. *(with a prior stint in technology and healthcare!)*

## Interests and Hobbies

***Hobbies in active development***: running, karaoke, board games, learning coding.  
~~*Deprecated hobbies: cycling, photography, social dance.*~~

Despite always getting picked last in gym class in grade school, I've somehow mustered up [running a marathon](http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org) (*slowly*), running two half-marathons (*slightly faster*), completed [three](http://www.ridetomontauk.com/) [century](https://nycc.org/SIGs) rides (*one with 8,268 ft of total climbing*), competed in an [olympic-distance triathalon](http://www.nyctri.com/) (*barely*), and participated in a [200 mile, 24-hour team relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_the_Beach_Relay) (*half asleep*). Don't let any of this fool you, I have no talent for sporty-type things... I merely collect expensive participation awards.

Oh, and I never say "no" to karaoke. :microphone::notes::notes:
