This is where you can find a gathering of my long(er)-form writing that's often spread out among a variety of other platforms. These run the gamut from professional topics like product management, personal interests like consumer technology, gaming, and my learning programming, to the political, like identity issues around gender and race.

Shorter posts and site updates can be found [here in this post index](/blog/updates_by_year.html).
